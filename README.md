# KeybindAudio
Plays audio when certain keybinds are pressed

## Features
I made this so that I could have custom sounds played when I mute/unmute my microphone or activate/deactivate my voice changer

* Assign a given key combination to two different sound files
  * One is the "Toggle On" sound effect, and the other is the "Toggle Off" sound effect
  * If you don't want separate sounds for toggling on and off, just assign the same sound file to both
* Plays the audio file into your default playback device when the key combination is pressed
* Supports .wav, .mp3, .aiff, .ogg, and .flac files
* Configure as many key combinations as you want
* The program can be minimised to the system tray to run in the background
